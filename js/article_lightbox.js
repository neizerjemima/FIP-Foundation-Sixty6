            "For my personalproject, I took on the challenge of refreshing the Quatro brand, a popular drink from the 80s that was famous in the UK. The main goal was to give the brand a new look and feel, and to create a series of responsive websites that would scale seamlessly across different devices. To achieve this, I designed three websites: the index page, shop page, and contact page. The index page serves as the main landing page for the brand, providing an overview of its history and products. I carefully curated the content and design elements to create an engaging and informative user experience.",
