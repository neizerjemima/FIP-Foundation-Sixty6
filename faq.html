                    <li> <h4> What is Foundation Sixty6?</h4></li> <br>
                    <p>Foundation Sixty6 is formed by the parents and supporters of a child who has experienced significant barriers in accessing adequate mental healthcare for severe conditions that have recently been diagnosed under the umbrella of psychotic depression.</p>
                     
                    <li> <h4> What is the mission of Foundation Sixty6?</h4></li> <br>
                     <p> The mission is To facilitate improved access to mental healthcare for youth between the ages of 16 and 25 suffering from psychosis, bipolar disorder (BPD), and schizophrenia, specifically within Southwestern Ontario.
                    We aim to achieve this by creating a network of physicians and mental healthcare
                    providers who will offer counselling services for free, or at a reduced rate, and by
                    generating donations / funds to support that access.
                    We also aim to create long term employment opportunities that understand the flexibility
                    and support required by people with severe mental health challenges.</p>
